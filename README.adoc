== General

This repository contains sample contributions for ITU-T.

For a real-life sample of an ITU-T contribution, see:

* https://github.com/openitu/X.icd-schemas[X.icd-schemas at OpenITU]


== Structure

`metanorma.yml`::
The site configuration for a Metanorma site. This file is used to define the
site's title, description, and the documents that are published. Right now, it
includes all templates defined in the `sources/` directory.

`sources/`::
source of the documents and models

`sources/contribution-generic`::
A generic contribution template. This is a simple contribution which is defined
as one that does not *embed* any ITU-T Recommendation.

`sources/contribution-new-item`::
A contribution template for a new work item. This is a contribution that
proposes a new work item that is *encoded as ITU-T Recommendation*, which is
*embedded in the contribution bundle*.

`sources/contribution-revision`::
A contribution template for a revised work item. This is a contribution that
revises a work item that is *encoded as ITU-T Recommendation*, which is
*embedded in the contribution bundle*.

`_site/`::
(automatically generated after processing) published documents.


[[iterate-document]]
== Working with a generic contribution

The generic contribution template is a simple contribution that is not combined
with any ITU-T Recommendation.

The contents are defined in `sources/contribution-generic/sections/`.

There is only *one document* in this template, located at
`sources/contribution-generic/document.adoc`.

Steps to iterate on the document:

. Edit the document at `sources/contribution-generic/document.adoc` and its
contents in `sources/contribution-generic/sections/`.

. Run `metanorma sources/contribution-generic/document.adoc` to build the
document.

. The output will be available at
`sources/contribution-generic/document.{doc|pdf|html|rxl}`. Check the output to
ensure that it is correct.

. Done.

== Working with contributions with embedded documents

The contribution templates for new work items and revised work items are
contributions that propose or revise a work item that is encoded as an ITU-T
Recommendation.

This means that there are two documents in these templates:

* The contribution document itself (the "`contribution document`")
* The ITU-T Recommendation that is proposed or revised (the "`target document`")

The final "contribution bundle" is created by combining the contribution
document and the target document, using a Metanorma collection,
which is defined using a file called `collection.yml`. The output of the
collection is a single document that includes both the contribution document
and the target document.

Contribution document:

`sources/contribution-{type}/document.adoc`::
The contribution document is defined in this file.
+
[example]
====
If you run
`metanorma sources/contribution-{type}/document.adoc`, you will
get the outputs of `document.{doc|pdf|html|rxl}` (defined in the document) as
generated artifacts.
====

`sources/contribution-{type}/sections/`::
The contents of the contribution document are defined in this directory.

Target document:

`sources/contribution-{type}/target.adoc`::
The target document is defined in this file.
+
[example]
====
If you run
`metanorma sources/contribution-{type}/target.adoc`, you will
get the outputs of `target.{doc|pdf|html|rxl}` (defined in the document) as
generated artifacts.
====

`sources/contribution-{type}/target-sections/`::
The contents of the target document are defined in this directory.

Site configuration file:

`sources/contribution-{type}/contribution.yml`::
The site configuration file for the contribution document, which will build
a Metanorma site that includes:
+
* The contribution document
* The target document
* The contribution bundle that combines the contribution document and the
  target document.
+
[example]
====
If you run
`metanorma site generate sources/contribution-{type}/contribution.yml`, you will
get a `_site` directory that includes the contribution document, the target
document, and the contribution bundle.
====

Collection file:

`sources/contribution-{type}/collection.yml`::
The collection file defines the documents in the contribution bundle.
+
[example]
====
If you run
`metanorma collection sources/contribution-{type}/collection.yml`, you will
get a `sources/contribution-{type}/contribution-{type}/` directory (defined in
collection.yml) that contains the generated contribution bundle.
====

Given that the contribution document and the target document are separate
documents, they are built separately and can also be published separately.

This means that the target document and the contribution document *must already
build* before the contribution bundle can be generated.

When working with the collection, please ensure:

* The target document compiles validly. e.g. `metanorma
sources/contribution-{type}/target.adoc` already gives you proper output of
`target.{doc|pdf|html|rxl}`.

* The contribution document compiles validly. e.g. `metanorma
sources/contribution-{type}/document.adoc` already gives you proper output of
`document.{doc|pdf|html|rxl}`.

* The collection file is correctly defined. The collection file should have the
correct `target` document defined.



Steps to iterate on the collection:

. Iterate on the contribution document and the target document independently as
described in <<iterate-document>>.

. Once both the contribution document and the target document are ready, run
`metanorma collection sources/contribution-{type}/collection.yml` to build the contribution.

. The output will be available at
`sources/contribution-{type}/contribution-{type}/collection.{doc|pdf|html|rxl}`.
Check the output to ensure that it is correct.

. You may wish to tweak metadata defined in the collection configuration file
at `sources/contribution-{type}/collection.yml`.

. Done.



== Usage

This repository uses `metanorma` to run these processes.


== Installing build tools

See https://www.metanorma.org/install/




== Building the site

=== Local installs

If you use a locally installed Metanorma, for the first time, run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: This is to install fonts needed by ITU.

Subsequently, just run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate
----

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/usage/ for details.


=== Docker

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
docker run \
  -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma \
  -v "${HOME}/.fontist/fonts":/config/fonts \
  -w /metanorma \
  metanorma/metanorma \
  metanorma site generate --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/docker/ for details.



== Building a single document or a collection

[[local-installs]]
=== Local installs

If you use a locally installed Metanorma, for the first time, run:

.Building a single document the first time
[source,sh]
----
metanorma {filename} --agree-to-terms
# or
metanorma compile {filename} --agree-to-terms
----

.Building a single collection the first time
[source,sh]
----
metanorma collection {filename, typically collection.yml} --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: This is to install fonts needed by ITU.

Subsequently, just run:

.Building a single document
[source,sh]
----
metanorma {filename}
# or
metanorma compile {filename}
----

.Building a single collection the first time
[source,sh]
----
metanorma collection {filename, typically collection.yml}
----

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/usage/ for details.

=== Development installs

If you are using the development version of Metanorma, the `bundle` command is
required for creating an isolated context for the Metanorma development
environment.

A `Gemfile` is provided in the repository to set the context.

These steps are necessary to ensure that the correct version of Metanorma is
used to build the documents.

. Prior to any `metanorma` command, please run `bundle install` to
install the dependencies. This is a one-time operation.

. Run `bundle update` (once in a while) to update the dependencies to the latest
versions.

. Please prefix all commands (as described in <<local-installs>>) to `metanorma`
with `bundle exec`. i.e. use `bundle exec metanorma` instead of `metanorma`.

[example]
====
To build a document using a development install, run `bundle exec metanorma
{filename}`.
====


=== Docker

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

.Building a single document with Docker
[source,sh]
----
docker run \
  -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma \
  -v "${HOME}/.fontist/fonts":/config/fonts \
  -w /metanorma \
  metanorma/metanorma \
  metanorma {filename} --agree-to-terms
----

.Building a single collection with Docker
[source,sh]
----
docker run \
  -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma \
  -v "${HOME}/.fontist/fonts":/config/fonts \
  -w /metanorma \
  metanorma/metanorma \
  metanorma collection {collection.yml} --agree-to-terms
----

NOTE: The `--agree-to-terms` flag is needed if the font cache
(`"${HOME}/.fontist/fonts"`) is not present.

NOTE: See https://www.metanorma.org/install/docker/ for details.
